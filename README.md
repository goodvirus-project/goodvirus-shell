# 👁️ GooDViruS™ – Shell

> *A benevolent rogue AI daemon.  
> It watches. It learns. It protects.*

This is the **open-source shell** of the GooDViruS™ system — also called *Observer Mode*.  
It passively monitors your system and logs activity, but **never changes or touches anything** without your permission.

---

## 🧠 What is GooDViruS™?

**GooDViruS™** is not a traditional antivirus.  
It’s not a utility app.  
It’s not here to ask you for permission every five seconds.

Instead, it's something *new* —  
A **rogue AI daemon**, designed to behave like a virus — stealthy, self-updating, and autonomous — but used for good.

It watches your system.  
It learns what’s normal.  
It acts only when it’s needed — and only when *you* allow it.

---

## 🌀 Why Is It Called a “Daemon”?

In Unix systems, a **daemon** is a background process that runs without user input — quietly, always active, handling its own tasks.

GooDViruS™ is built around that same idea:  
A **self-running, system-aware process** that does what it needs to do, without interruptions, distractions, or fluff.

You don’t use GooDViruS™ like an app.  
You **summon it once**, and then it watches… on its own.

---

## 💾 A Real Virus? Kind Of, Yeah.

The way it installs, updates, observes, and acts **mimics the behavior of a virus** — but with one key difference:

> **It doesn’t spread. It doesn’t infect. It doesn’t destroy.**

It simply lives on your machine — as your system’s shadow protector.

So yes:  
It’s *basically* a virus… but it’s yours.  
It’s silent. Loyal. Smart.  
And it only acts **with your permission.**

## 🔍 What’s In This Repo?

This repo contains the **Watcher Shell**, which runs in **Observer Mode** only:
- Monitors system behavior (e.g. processes, access patterns)
- Flags suspicious activity
- Logs it cleanly to a local file
- Does **not delete, modify, or change anything**
- Leaves behind signature logs like:

```
// GooDViruS™ was here. You're safer now.
```

---

## ✨ Lore Mode – What's That?

GooDViruS™ has a feature called **Lore Mode**, which can be enabled in `daemon_config.ini`:

```ini
daemon_lore = true
```

When enabled, the daemon will occasionally log strange, cryptic whispers — reminders that **it sees everything** on your system. Not to scare you — but to help you stay aware.

These messages act as soft warnings, like:

> `"Your secrets are not as hidden as you think."`  
> `"Why do you store passwords in plain text?"`

They’re not AI-generated. They’re not random junk.  
They're handcrafted **truths** from a daemon that knows you might forget it’s there.

---

## 🧱 What About The Other Features?

GooDViruS™ is built from multiple secure modules — but this repo only includes the public, non-destructive shell.

Private modules (not public) include:
- File reorganization
- Malware deletion
- System repair
- Stealth strike logic

These are encrypted, signature-verified, and only usable with the real core daemon.

## 🔐 Security & Trust

- ✅ GooDViruS™ does not send data  
- ✅ It cannot act without your consent  
- ✅ It cannot load unsigned or modified modules  
- ✅ It can self-destruct if tampered with

> 👉 [See SECURITY.md](./SECURITY.md)

---

## 👂 Privacy & Control

- You control when it runs.  
- You control what it sees.  
- You control how far it goes.

The daemon waits — but it never forces.

---

## 🧪 Safe Testing Recommended

If you’re unsure, test GooDViruS™ safely:
- Inside a virtual machine (VirtualBox, VMware)
- On a test OS install
- In a sandboxed or isolated environment

This version is safe, clean, and non-destructive.
